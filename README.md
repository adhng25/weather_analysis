# Weather analysis
This is the final project for the CS 151 Introduction to Computational Problem Solving class. In the assignment, I analyze and compare two datasets containing daily weather entries from South Hadley - one from 2006 and the other from 2018. In the two Python files, I calculated the average temperature, humidity, and wind speed, found day with highest temperature difference, and calculated the highest wind speed 7-day period.
